Changelog:

About popup has been updated
An error popup has been added to "Compile" and "Compile and Compress" upon failure
A bug causing NARCTool GUI to continue running in the background when closing with the X button has been fixed

=================
NARCTool GUI 0.3
=================
Credits to FrankieD for making the GUI and custom scripts.
Credits to Vendor for dumping the source code.

A GUI has been created in favor of multiple scripts
If you wish to continue using individual scripts please use version 0.2-p

Below are previous update notes

==============================================================
NARCTool 0.2-p - modified by FrankieD, Vendor, and Zekromaegis
==============================================================
Simplified scripts were created for quicker use

Extract.py
All files ending in ".narc" will be extracted
Place your NARC(s) in this folder and run "Extract.py"
A new folder will appear named after the NARC(s) you extracted followed by "_extracted"

Compile.py
All folders ending with "_extracted" will be compiled
After running Compile.py your compiled NARC(s) will appear in the same folder your NARC(s) were extracted to

Although they are very rarely used I included Compress/Decompress variants of the above scripts

Should either script not function as expected run NARCTool.py in Windows CMD or a CMD equivalent

==============
narctool 0.1-p
==============
This modified version of narctool has been made so that it works with
filename-less NARC files like those in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl by
creating files named (narc_name).(file_number).(file_type)

Refer to the original readme, below:
