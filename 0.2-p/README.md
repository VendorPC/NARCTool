# NARCTool 0.2-p

### Modified by FrankieD, Vendor, and Zekromaegis

Simplified scripts were created for quicker use

Extract.py

All files ending in ".narc" will be extracted

Place your NARC(s) in this folder and run "Extract.py"

A new folder will appear named after the NARC(s) you extracted followed by "_extracted"

Compile.py

All folders ending with "_extracted" will be compiled

After running Compile.py your compiled NARC(s) will appear in the same folder your NARC(s) were extracted to

Although they are very rarely used I included Compress/Decompress variants of the above scripts

Should either script not function as expected run NARCTool.py in Windows CMD or a CMD equivalent
